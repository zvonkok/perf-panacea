\section{Perf Tool}
{\em Perf} is a event oriented observability tool that can help to
answer specific performance questions and issues. It can be used
to trace and probe the kernel and user space. It is part of the
Linux kernel an available on any Linux distribution.

{\em Perf} can be used to do static tracing, dynamic tracing, record
and count software, \infull{PMU} (\PMU\) and
lately also \infull{eBPF} (\eBPF\) events.

For each of these event sources there will be examples how to count or
record these events and how to interpret them. But first some
fundamental topics.
