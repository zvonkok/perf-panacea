\section{Call-Stacks}

In \in[framep] \about[framep] it was described what a stack is and how
it works.  In this section one will use {\em perf} to capture or
sample these {\em call-stacks} and visualize the in a very specific
way, namely in a {\em flamegraph}.

But first lets print out some example call-stacks from a running
application and deduce how to interpret a {\em flamegraph}. For this
the {\tt eu-stack}\sidenote{For Java use {\tt jstacks}} tool will be
used for examination. It shows call-stacks from an application
currently running.

The application used here is {\tt pi} from the {\em gmpbench} suite. It
calculates the number $\pi$ up to the, as an argument given, decimal places.

\margintext{Calculate 1000 decimal places for the number $\pi$ using
  Chudnovsky's algorithm and show info about the \ELF\ auxiliary
  vector. \ELF\ auxiliary vectors are a mechanism to transfer certain
  kernel level information to the user processes}

During the runtime of {\tt pi} one can call {\tt eu-stack -p `pidof
  pi`} periodically e.g. every 1/2 seconds to simulate the call-stack
sampling of {\tt perf record -F2 } with a frequency of {\em 2 Hz}. This way
one can manually collect 2 call-stacks per second.

Here are 3 call-stack samples from the beginning of {\tt pi}.

\margintext{The addresses for {\tt build_sieve} can be and are different, because this was the active
  stack frame, when sampled, and the address is the {\em instruction pointer} at that time. To know
where in the code one was exactly when sampled, {\tt addr2line} can be used}

Now to visualize the call-stacks one needs additional software that is
available on {\em github}.

\starttyping
git clone https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph.git
\stoptyping

There are several tools to convert {\em call-stacks} from different
source ({\em perf,dtrace,...}) to a format that {\tt flamegraphs.pl}
understands. First it will be done manually and then shown how to
automate these steps with {\em perf}.

The input file for {\tt flamegraphs.pl} is as follows, each line
defines exactly one unique {\em call-stack} with the count of it.
So e.g. in the case above the {\em folded} {\em call-stack} file
should look like this.

\starttyping
# cat pi.man.folded
_start;__libc_start_main;generic_start_main;main;picomp;build_sieve 3
\stoptyping

This file can now be used to generate the {\em flamegraph}.

\starttyping
cat pi.man.folded > flamegraph.pl > pi.man.svg
\stoptyping

\section{Perf Flamegraph}

The previous chapter showed how one can generate a {\em flamegraph} manually. Now
let's see how to automate or generate a {\em flamegraph} with {\em perf}.

First, sample the workload with the {\tt --call-graph=dwarf} switch.

\margintext{Limit the frequency of sampling to your needs, otherwise {\em perf} could
slow down your system to uselessness, there is a lot of \CPU\ and memory load. }
\starttyping
# perf record -F99 --call-graph=dwarf -- ./pi 1000
\stoptyping

Combine all the steps explained above to one line and generate the {\em flamegraph}.

\starttyping
# perf script | stackcollapse-perf.pl | flamegraph.pl > pi.svg
\stoptyping


\setupcaption [figure][location={bottom}]
\startplacefigure[title={Complete Flamegraph of {\tt pi}}]
\externalfigure[pi.svg][fullwidth]
\stopplacefigure

The generated \SVG\ is a interactive graphic, where one can search for
a symbol or just activate a specific {\em call-stack} by clicking on
it. The broader a bar is the more samples where gathered for this {\em
  call-stack} and hence more time was spent in it. Beware that {\em
  perf} was in sampling mode, which means, that {\em call-stack} that
were really small in time, can but not necesserialy have to be
sampled. If {\em call-stacks} are missing try to increase the sampling
frequency.


\section{Differential Flamegraphs}
Differential flame graphs visualize the differences between two
performance profiles. It can be used e.g. for regression runs or to
identify possible performance enhancement like compiler switches,
tuning parameters and so on. Let's try to examine how the different
optimization levels affect performance of the workload {\tt
  pi}. Therefore the workload will be compiled with {\tt -O1, -O2,
  -O3} and the corresponding {\em flamegraphs} for each run will be
generated. The last step is to generate the {\em differential
  flamegraphs} to see the differences.

First generate the workloads.
\starttyping
# gcc -O3 -g pi.c -o pi.3 -static -lgmp -lm
# gcc -O2 -g pi.c -o pi.2 -static -lgmp -lm
# gcc -O1 -g pi.c -o pi.1 -static -lgmp -lm
\stoptyping

Now for each optimization level sample the {\em call-stacks}

\starttyping
# perf record -F99 --call-graph=dwarf -o pi.1.data -- ./pi.1 1000
# perf record -F99 --call-graph=dwarf -o pi.2.data -- ./pi.2 1000
# perf record -F99 --call-graph=dwarf -o pi.3.data -- ./pi.3 1000
\stoptyping

The next step is to generate the folded stacks.

\starttyping
# perf script -i pi.1.data | stackcollapse-perf.pl > pi.1.folded
# perf script -i pi.2.data | stackcollapse-perf.pl > pi.2.folded
# perf script -i pi.3.data | stackcollapse-perf.pl > pi.3.folded
\stoptyping

And as a last step the {\em differential flamegraphs} can be created.
\starttyping
difffolded.pl -n pi.1.folded pi.2.folded | flamegraph.pl --negate > pi.diff12.svg
difffolded.pl -n pi.2.folded pi.3.folded | flamegraph.pl --negate > pi.diff23.svg
\stoptyping


\placefigure
  [here]
  [fig:fgdiff]
  {Differential Flamegraphs between compiler optimization levels}
  {\startcombination[1*2]
    {\externalfigure[pi.diff12.svg][textwidth]}
    {\externalfigure[pi.diff23.svg][textwidth]}
  \stopcombination}

Functions that are performing better are coloured blue and functions that
perform worse are coloured red. The intensity shows how much better or worse
the functions get in terms of performance.

\section{Java Flamegraph}

The nice thing about {\em perf} with {\em Java} is that it's possible
to not only sample {\em Java} like {\em Jinsight} but it can also
sample the \JVM\ with the {\em garbage collector}, userspace and the
kernel. The complete stack can be examined and analyzed.

Since {\em Java} has a deep call hierarchy one should increase the
maximum stack-frame count so that the complete {\em call-stack} is
recorded.

\starttyping
# sysctl -w kernel.perf_event_max_stack=512
\stoptyping

For the \infull{JIT} (\JIT\) compiled methods {\em perf} needs
additional information to map the samples correctly to the
symbols. {\em Perf} has a nifty mechanism for finding missing mappings
(from instruction addresses to symbols/methods). When {\tt perf
  report} encounters missing mappings it searches for maps in {\tt
  /tmp/perf-<pid>.map}. This allows runtimes that generate code on the
fly to supply dynamic symbol mappings to be used with {\em perf}.
That is the file where the next tool will create mappings for
\JIT\-compiled methods.

\starttyping
# git clone  https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/perf-map-agent.git
cd perf-map-agent
cmake .
make
\stoptyping

There is another issue with {\em Java} namely the {\em frame-pointer}.
The \JVM\ compiler is ommiting the {\em frame-pointer} and not generating
\DWARF\ debuginfo to unwind the stack. Luckily since \JDK\ Version 8 there
is a new option to preserve the {\em frame-pointer}. Beware that preserving
the {\em frame-pointer} the performance can degrade by up to 2\%. A prerequisite
for sampling {\em Java call-stacks} is the following option.
\margintext{This option is not (yet) available in the \IBM\ \JDK\ }
\starttyping
-XX:+PreserveFramePointer
\stoptyping

For the next steps one will use the workload {\em SPECjbb2005} with the modified
{\em Java} command line. To record and get the right maps for the workload
the scripts in {\tt perf-map-agent/bin} can be used for easy of use. But first
export  {\tt JAVA_HOME} to the correct \JDK\ .

\starttyping
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.9.0-openjdk-amd64
\stoptyping

First start the workload.
\starttyping
./SPECjbb2005Run 1073741824  /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.9.0-openjdk-amd64/bin  4096m   4096m   jitc  0   0 1  ""   0  0 "keep"
\stoptyping


Now collect the {\em call-stacks}.
